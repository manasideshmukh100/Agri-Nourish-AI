# 🌾 Agri-Nourish AI – Agricultural App Backend & Platform

Hi, I’m **Manasi Deshmukh**, and this repository hosts the backend and project overview for **Agri-Nourish AI** — a smart agricultural platform aiming to leverage AI, data insights, and smart services to empower farmers and support sustainable farming practices.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

Agri-Nourish AI is designed to help farmers & agri-businesses monitor, analyse, and act on agricultural data — from crop health and resource usage to market trends and sustainability practices.  
The goal is to use machine learning and smart analytics to improve yields, optimise inputs (water, fertiliser, pesticide) and support decision-making for small-to-medium farms.

## 🧩 Key Objectives

- **Crop Monitoring & Prediction:** Build AI/ML models to analyse crop health, forecast yields, detect diseases/pests.  
- **Resource Optimisation:** Optimise use of water, fertiliser, pesticides to reduce waste and environmental impact.  
- **Market & Trend Insights:** Analyse market data, pricing, seasonal trends so farmers can make better decisions.  
- **Sustainable Farming Practices:** Suggest crop rotation, cover cropping, organic techniques to promote sustainability.  
- **Education & Engagement:** Provide tools/mobile access for farmers, and foster community knowledge-sharing.

## 🚀 Features

- Data collection architecture (IoT, drones, satellites) for soil, weather, crop data  
- AI analytics dashboard (prototype) providing actionable insights and recommendations  
- Mobile/web UI (planned) where farmers can access live alerts, view their plots, tasks & metrics  
- Community/forum features for farmer collaboration and knowledge sharing
